NEWS about the publib project
=============================

Version 0.40
------------

    * Lars Wirzenius has passed maintenance of publib to
      Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho.

    * Publib no longer includes the framework; instead, a conventional
      configure--make build system is provided.  Publib now consists
      of the library modules formerly known as liw-modules.

    * Minor bugfixes have been made to the library modules.


Version 0.39
------------

    * liw/cfgtool has been removed. It was obsolete since about a decade.
    
    * liw/strutils/strsplit has been fixed, thanks to bug report from
      Ron Fox.
