.SH NAME
stracat \- concatenate many strings into an allocated memory block
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <publib.h>
char *\fBstracat\fR(const char *\fIs\fR, ...);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIstracat\fR will allocate a block of memory with malloc and concatenate
all arguments strings into this block.  The user is supposed
to free the returned block.  The end of the argument list is signalled
by a null pointer.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fIstracat\fR returns a pointer to the allocated block,
or NULL if it could not be allocated.
.SH EXAMPLE
To concatenate "hello, " and "world", one might say the following.
.sp 1
.nf
.in +5
p = stracat("hello, ", "world", (char *)NULL);
if (p != NULL)
	puts(p);
.in -5
.sp 1
Please note that it is necessary to case NULL as in the example above,
since there is no information about the type of the argument available
in the prototype, and since an unadorned NULL might not be of the 
correct type.  (See any good C reference book or the comp.lang.c FAQ for
more information.)
