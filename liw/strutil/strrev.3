.TH STRREV 3 "C Programmer's Manual" Publib "C Programmer's Manual"
.SH NAME
strrev \- reverse a string in place
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <publib.h>
char *\fBstrrev\fR(char *\fIstr\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIstrrev\fR reverses the argument string in place, i.e., it swaps
the \fIi\fRth character from the beginning with the \fIi\fRth
character from the end.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fIstrrev\fR returns its argument.
.SH EXAMPLE
Reversing "dlrow, elloh" would be done like the following.
.sp 1
.nf
.in +5
char str[] = "dlrow, elloh";

puts(strrev(str));
.in -5
.sp 1
.fi
This would output "hello, world".
Note that using the string literal as the argument would be an error,
since it is not allowable to modify string literals.
.SH BUGS
Does not automatically detect palindromes, nor automatically return
without doing anything.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
