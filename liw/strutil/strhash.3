.SH NAME
strhash \- hash function for strings
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <publib.h>
unsigned long \fBstrhash\fR(const char *\fIs\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIstrhash\fR is a hash function for strings.  It uses an algorithm
that tries to be good in most cases, but it is often possible to use
a better algorithm that takes better into account the characteristics
of the data for a given application.  However, \fIstrhash\fR often
good enough; test it before spending time to develop a better one.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fIstrhash\fR returns the computed hash value.  Note that the value
is not scaled into any particular range (all values that an unsigned
long can take are possible).  The caller will have to do the scaling
himself.
