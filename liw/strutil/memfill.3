.SH NAME
memfill \- fill memory area with pattern
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <publib.h>
void *\fBmemfill\fR(void *\fIbuf\fR, size_t \fIsize\fR, const void *\fIpat\fR, size_t \fIpatsize\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fImemfill\fR copies consecutive bytes from the pattern \fIpat\fR to
consecutive bytes in the memory area \fIbuf\fR, wrapping around in
\fIpat\fR when its end is reached.  \fIpatsize\fR is the size of
the pattern, \fIsize\fR is the size of the memory area.  The pattern
and the memory area must not be overlapping.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fImemfill\fR returns its first argument.
.SH EXAMPLE
To initialize an integer array one might do the following.
.sp 1
.nf
.in +5
int temp, array[1024];

temp = 1234;
memfill(array, sizeof(array), &temp, sizeof(temp));
.in -5
