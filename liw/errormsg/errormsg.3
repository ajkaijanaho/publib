.TH ERRORMSG 3
.SH NAME
errormsg, set_progname, get_progname \- printing error messages
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <errormsg.h>
.sp 1
.nf
void \fIerrormsg\fR(int exitp, int eno, const char *fmt, ...);
void \fIset_progname\fR(const char *argv0, const char *def);
const char *\fIget_progname\fR(void);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The \fIerrormsg\fR function is used for printing error messages.  It
is a like a combination of fprintf(3) and perror(3), in that it makes
it easy to add arbitrary, printf-like formatted text to the output,
and makes it easy to include the system's error message (the error
string corresponding to the eno parameter).  Unlike perror, this
function does not get the error code directly from errno, thus making
it easier to do something else that might set it before printing out
the error message.  \fIerrormsg\fR also adds the name of the program
to the output, if known.
.PP
The first argument to \fIerrormsg\fR should be 0 (don't exit program),
1 (exit program with \fIexit(EXIT_FAILURE)\fR) or 2 (with
\fIabort()\fR).  The second one should be 0 (don't print system error
message), positive (print error message corresponding to the error
code), or -1 (print the error message corresponding to \fIerrno\fR).
.PP
The \fIset_progname\fR function sets the program name.  You need to
call this function with at least one non-NULL parameter to get the
program names included in the output.  If either argument is non-NULL,
it should point at strings that have static duration, i.e. they exist
until the program terminates (or at least until the last error message
has been printed); this is so that it is not necessary to create a
copy of the name.  (Either or both arguments can also be NULL.)
.PP
If the first argument is non-NULL, that is used as the name, otherwise
the seconds argument is used.  If both are NULL, no program name is
included in the output.  The reason for having two arguments is so
that the caller doesn't have to do the test, and can just call
.sp 1
.ti +5
     \fIset_progname(argv[0], "default_name");\fR
.sp 1
(it is valid for argv[0] to be NULL, under ISO C).
.PP
The \fIget_progname\fR function returns a pointer to the current name
of the program, as set by \fIset_progname\fR.  If \fIget_progname\fR
returns NULL, then no name has been set and none is included in the
output.  This function is included for completeness, it is not really
expected to be useful.
