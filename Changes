This file has now been abandoned in favor of debian/changelog.

Version 0.27 (released Tue Nov 11 04:39:30 EET 1997):

	* Fixed bug in liw/sbuf/sbuf_io.c that didn't create good
	  permissions for new files. Now sets the permissions to
	  umask & 0666 (used to set to just 0600 without checking
	  the umask).
	* liw/log: Added pid to output, and made timezone (UTC or
	  localtime) selectable. This changes the log file format.
	* liw/cfg: Added possibility to get unknown variables from
	  input without causing errors.
	* liw/cfg: Added cfg_read_open_file and cfg_write_open_file,
	  so that input and output can be done with stdin and stdout.
	* liw/cfg: Added flags cfg_removed (the routines to write
	  configuration files ignore variables with that flag set),
	  and cfg_userflagX (X=1..8) for users to use.

Version 0.26 (released Sun Apr 27 03:02:22 EEST 1997):

	* Moved all includes to beginning of line. Stupid, broken,
	  non-standard compilers should be shot, drowned, buried,
	  and fixed.
	* liw/lsm/lsm_error.c: Removed #include <errno.h>, since it
	  breaks compilation under glibc (which presumably #defines
	  errno as a macro; that's an OK thing to do). It was unnecessary
	  anyway.
	* liw/lockfile/lockfile.c: Added missing #include <string.h> to
	  get all necessary prototypes.

Version 0.25 (released Sat Dec 28 00:49:12 EET 1996):

	* Changed framework/Default.config to set modules to ../liw,
	  since that is the suggested configuration.
	* framework/Makefile.in sets permissions on directory it creates.
	* Added note about VPATH/GNU Make to framework/README.
	* Added some preliminary stuff for undo. (It doesn't work yet,
	  but should be harmless.)
	* Removed some old code that has been commented out for ages.

Version 0.24 (released Thu Dec  5 11:28:02 EET 1996):

	* liw/sbuf/sbuf_io.c: sbuf_load(): don't set dirty flag when
	  loading file that doesn't exist or that can't be read
	* liw/cfgtool: removed help file interface; fixed name comparison
	  bug (foo matched foobar)
	* liw/sbuf: Added columnar blocks.

Version 0.23 (released Wed Nov  6 20:03:22 EET 1996):

	* sbuf_write_to_file: fixed bug that prevented any output to 
	  the file (byte count used as loop counter and zeroed by loop)

Version 0.22 (released Tue Nov  5 23:48:12 EET 1996):

	* Added module base64.
	* Added module lockfile.
	* Added module cfgtool.
	* liw/files: Added file_read, file_read_open, file_write that
	  read and write complete files.
	* liw/sbuf/sbuf_io.c: Rewrote sbuf_write_to_file so it doesn't
	  use O(n) bytes of memory.
	* Added framework/Default.config.
	* Added debian/*.

This change history starts after version 0.21 was released.
