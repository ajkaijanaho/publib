Version 0.25 (released Sat Dec 28 00:49:12 EET 1996):

	* Changed framework/Default.config to set modules to ../liw,
	  since that is the suggested configuration.
	* framework/Makefile.in sets permissions on directory it creates.
	* Added note about VPATH/GNU Make to framework/README.
	* Added some preliminary stuff for undo. (It doesn't work yet,
	  but should be harmless.)
	* Removed some old code that has been commented out for ages.

Version 0.24 (released Thu Dec  5 11:28:02 EET 1996):

	* liw/sbuf/sbuf_io.c: sbuf_load(): don't set dirty flag when
	  loading file that doesn't exist or that can't be read
	* liw/cfgtool: removed help file interface; fixed name comparison
	  bug (foo matched foobar)
	* liw/sbuf: Added columnar blocks.

Version 0.23 (released Wed Nov  6 20:03:22 EET 1996):

	* sbuf_write_to_file: fixed bug that prevented any output to 
	  the file (byte count used as loop counter and zeroed by loop)

Version 0.22 (released Tue Nov  5 23:48:12 EET 1996):

	* Added module base64.
	* Added module lockfile.
	* Added module cfgtool.
	* liw/files: Added file_read, file_read_open, file_write that
	  read and write complete files.
	* liw/sbuf/sbuf_io.c: Rewrote sbuf_write_to_file so it doesn't
	  use O(n) bytes of memory.
	* Added framework/Default.config.
	* Added debian/*.

This change history starts after version 0.21 was released.
