.SH NAME
strinit \- initialize a string with a given character to a given length
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <publib.h>
char *\fBstrinit\fR(char *\fIs\fR, int \fIc\fR, size_t \fIlen\fR) {
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIstrinit\fR initializes the string pointed to by \fIs\fR to be of
length \fIlen\fR, all characters being \fIc\fR, where the terminating '\e0'
is \fInot\fR included in the length, i.e., the string will use
\fIlen+1\fR characters.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fIstrinit\fR will return \fIs\fR.
.SH EXAMPLE
To initialize a string to consist of twenty underscores, one would
do the following.
.sp 1
.nf
.in +5
#include <publib.h>

char string[21];     /* note 21 to make room for '\e0' */
strinit(string, '_', 20);
