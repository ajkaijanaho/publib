.TH __SET_LIBERROR 3
.SH NAME
__set_liberror \- modify error handling for publib
.SH SYNOPSIS
#include <publib.h>
.sp 1
.br
void __set_liberror(enum __liberror);
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
Unless the documentation for the function specifies otherwise, the
default action when a library function notices an error is to abort
whatever it was doing and return an error indication.  It is possible
to change this behaviour with \fI__set_liberror(3)\fR.  The argument
should be a bitwise OR of the following values:
.sp 1
.nf
	__abort_on_error
	__exit_on_error
	__complain_on_error
.in +5
.in -5
.sp 1
Note that \fI__abort_on_error\fR and \fI__exit_on_error\fR are
mutually exclusive, only use one.
