.SH NAME
strdel \- delete characters from beginning of string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <publib.h>
char *\fBstrdel\fR(char *\fIs\fR, size_t \fIn\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIstrdel\fR removes the first \fIn\fR characters of \fIs\fR.  If
\fIn\fR is greater than the length of the string, all characters
in the string (not counting '\\0') are removed but no more.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fIstrdel\fR returns its first argument.
.SH EXAMPLE
To change all occurences of "Pascal" in the input to "Yuck!", you might do
the following:
.sp 1
.nf
.in +5
#include <string.h>
#include <stdio.h>
#include <publib.h>

int main(void) {
	char line[512];

	while (fgets(line, sizeof(line), stdio) != NULL) {
		while ((p = strstr(line, "Pascal")) != NULL) {
			strdel(p, 6);
			strins(p, "Yuck!");
		}
		printf("%s", line);
	}
	return 0;
}
