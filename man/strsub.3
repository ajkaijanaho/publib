.SH NAME
strsub \- substitute first occurence of pattern with another string
.SH SYNOPSIS
.nf
#include <publib.h>
char *\fBstrsub\fR(char *\fIstr\fR, const char *\fIpat\fR, const char *\fIsub\fR);
.SH DESCRIPTION
\fIstrsub\fR finds the first occurence of the pattern \fIpat\fR in the
string \fIstr\fR (using a method similar to \fIstrstr\fR(3), i.e., no
regular expressions), and replaces it with \fIsub\fR. 
If \fIpat\fR does not occur in \fIstr\fR, no substitution is made.
.PP
Of course, if \fIsub\fR is an empty string, the pattern is deleted from
the string.
.SH "RETURN VALUE"
\fIstrsub\fR returns a pointer to the first character after the substitution,
or NULL if no substitution was made.
.SH EXAMPLE
To substitute up to two occurences of "foo" with "bar" in a line,
one might do the following.
.sp 1
.nf
.in +5
p = strsub(line, "foo", "bar");
if (p != NULL)
	strsub(line, "foo", "bar");
.in -5
