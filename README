Publib is a heterogenous library for the C programming language,
originally intended as an extension of the standard library but now
mostly of legacy interest.  The library was written by Lars Wirzenius.
As of October 2006, it is maintained by Antti-Juhani Kaijanaho.
Publib is currently in maintenance mode: there are no plans to
introduce new functionality at this time.

Please check whether your operating system vendor provides a
prepackaged version of Publib.  Normally you should use that version
instead of installing from source, unless you have special needs.

For installing from source, the following should be enough to install
on a typical Linux or Unix system:

   ./configure
   make
   make install

The first two commands do not need any special privileges.  The third
requires write access to several directories in /usr/local/.  The
INSTALL file gives information about options you can give to configure
for customizing such an installation.

The following applies only to installations from source: Please retain
the configured source of the version you installed.  That will allow
you to uninstall the package using "make uninstall"; it is a good idea
to do that before installing a new version.

For library documentation, see the publib.3 and other manual pages
distributed with the library (in the man/ subdirectoryof the source
distribution).

Developers using the library and redistributors of the library are
encouraged to subscribe to the publib mailing list; send mail to
publib-subscribe@lists.kaijanaho.info to subscibe.  The list is
archived publically (updated once day) at
http://lists.kaijanaho.info/archives/publib/threads.html .  This list
will receive release announcements, and it is the preferred forum for
bug reports.

Development sources are hosted in Git.  There's a source browser at
  http://code.google.com/p/publib/source/browse/
and a local clone can be obtained via
  git clone https://code.google.com/p/publib/ 

Bugs may be reported to the mailing list, or (preferably) to the
issue tracker at http://code.google.com/p/publib/issues/list.

New releases (since 1.40) are distributed from
  http://code.google.com/p/publib/downloads/list
and are announced on the mailing list.

Happy hacking,

                           Ancient History
               (by Lars Wirzenius long, long time ago)

The Publib effort started from an article posted to gnu.misc.discuss,
comp.sources.d, and comp.software-eng at the end of February, 1992, by
Steve Nuchia.  He then created the mailing list which has been used
for communication, library@sccsi.com.  Several people were active in
the discussion at the beginning.  Lars Wirzenius built a few
prototypes for the framework, based on the discussions on the list.
Paul Sander and Greg Woods especially gave valuable comments on them.

Patrik Andersin noted the problem with running configure twice with different
module directories and the headers not being copied correctly.

The first version released outside of the list was 0.2, posted on
February 19 to alt.sources by Lars Wirzenius.

The list has been rather dead since the end of 1993.

The second version was 0.3, posted to alt.sources and put on
the ftp sites on July 16, 1994.

The third version was 0.4, not posted to alt.sources, only put on
the ftp sites on October 10, 1994.

The fourth version was 0.5, not posted to alt.sources or comp.sources.unix,
only put on the ftp sites in May, 1995.
