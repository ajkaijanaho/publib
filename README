This is the top level README for Publib.

Publib consists of a framework for building libraries, and my
set of modules. You can add and remove modules, the framework is
not tied to my modules. In fact, I hope you do -- the framework
intends to make it _easy_ to create new C libraries.

For more information, read framework/Blurb and framework/README.
For my modules, see liw/*.
